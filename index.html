	   					<h4>BTG Pactual Digital</h4>
	   					<p>After I graduated college, I was hired at BTG and started working as a junior analyst. I began to work with the variable income projects' squad and acted on substantial Research projects and regulatory issues. After a few months, we noticed a gap in our project flow, needing someone to handle variable income demands within the advisors portal. This was a challenging problem, as our team worked with a different architecture and developed Java applications, while in this portal, the applications were in Nodejs. I accepted this challenge, studied this new language, and approached the advisors' portal team, who helped me understand this structure and technologies used. Consequently, we increased the number of deployed projects, I was rated among the top 30 percent best employees, and today I am the leader of a squad that deals with these tasks.</p>

	   					<h4>BTG Pactual Digital</h4>
	   					<p>I joined BTG as an intern. At the time, I worked in the trading team and developed Java applications. During this period, I did my best to learn about equities and the team's service structures. At the end of my internship, I delivered my first significant feature, a project to register and list equities allocations and analysis made by the Research team. Even initially, with little market knowledge, I managed to deliver a well-structured project according to the norms, exceeding expectations and showing career projection within BTG.

	   					<h4>General Electric</h4>
	   					<p>I did an internship in GE's Grid Solutions Energy Transmission sector. I was in charge of tasks such as spreadsheets transcription and creation and tools translation. My most relevant job was helping create a device for validating and writing spreadsheets: I developed part of a Java program to approve and compose spreadsheets filled in by the client. This program intended to automate this process since there were a large number of spreadsheets. A text file was written in a specific format used by one of the company's tools along with the reading. With this activity, I could improve programming logic, exercise Java programming, and learn about components present in substations and their hierarchies.</p>

I decided to pursue my learning through this bold format, becoming part of Insper’s first Engineering class. This decision was made mainly because I realized that several of the course’s foundations, such as innovation and entrepreneurship, match my own values. The different formats the modules were taught and the way the excellent professors motivated us through classes and projects made my fellow undergrad students and me become another type of employee, a kind of worker the Brazilian technology market needs and appreciates.</p>

						<p>I participated in an exchange semester in Porto, Portugal. I had the opportunity to study at the engineering department at the University of Porto, also known as FEUP. By studying at this university, I learned new study skills, attended classes in complementary subjects to the ones offered by Insper, and was taught by other great professors known internationally. This international experience allowed me to get to know different cultures and people from different parts of the world. I focused on learning and developing new study skills, and due to my passion for Mathematics, I also deepen my knowledge in this subject. Therefore, I took the following modules: Numerical Analysis, Compilers, Computer Graphics, Multimedia and New Services.</p>

So in the summer of 2017, I enrolled in a summer program at Boston University in Boston, United States. During that time, I had the opportunity to acquire a vast amount of new knowledge while experiencing an American college student's life. While there, I took the following intensive courses: Complex Analysis and Data Structures with Java.

					      <h4>Support for Decision Making in Autonomous Vehicle</h4>		      
					      <p>This project explored the possibility of increasing the automation level of Embraer's air vehicle systems, seeking proximity to their autonomy. The possibility of using a decision system based on the OODA cycle (Observe – Orient – ​​Decide – Act) was studied. This cycle was validated through drones, which were exposed to events that tested their efficiency. The project's final objective was to validate the OODA cycle in the proposed scenario, which consisted on executing a mission: filming a previously delimited region and determining the presence of objects of interest while on autonomous mode. The independent system had to decide whether to continue completing the task or return to base, based on monitoring information such as battery level, GPS position, and local wind. Initially, a simplified scenario was adopted, in which the drone lost communication with the controller and returned to the beginning of its trajectory efficiently (video). After this recognition and study phase, the project's final objective was implemented.</p>

					      <p>The goal of this project was to apply the knowledge and techniques acquired in the Computer Graphics module from the University of Porto. 
							For this project, a four-wheeled motor vehicle and the terrain where the car travels were modeled and a graphical interface (GUI) was created with some controls to change scene parameters at runtime. In addition, a mechanism was designed to control the vehicle using the keys as follows: forward or backward as you press "W" or "S", and left or right as you press "A" or "D", respectively. An interface for the selection of textures was built, integrated into the application's GUI, and the terrain was modeled with altimetry. Finally, an articulated crane with a magnet that interacts with the vehicle was modeled.</p>

					      <h4>Venipuncture App</h4>		      
					      <p>An application program was developed in partnership with nursing master’s students from Albert Einstein Hospital. The app allows children to understand the venipuncture procedure in a ludic and interactive manner. Its development occurred in three stages: identification of client’s needs, the definition of components, and prototype elaboration. Besides being directed to the care and education of children and families, the app meets the nurses’ needs to prepare them for venipuncture. Moreover, it is worth mentioning the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for the concretion of similar projects.

					      <h4>Numerical Propagation of Space Bodies' Orbits Around The Earth</h4>		      
					      <p>To follow the growth of space study, Insper created a study to develop a software for analyzing orbital data. The project aimed to create a GUI in Matlab to simulate objects in orbit around the Earth and Moon. The model object of study contemplates the perturbations characteristic of the problem, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational force of other celestial bodies. Simulation involves the numerical integration of differential equations that model the trajectory of objects in orbit.</p>

					      <h4>GAB - My computer language</h4>		      
					      <p>For Insper's Computer Logic module's final project, I had to create my high-productivity programming language. This language contains variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and I/O. It is a language with reserved words in Portuguese, can print the value of mathematical expressions involving variables, and accepts inputs to assign values to variables. It also allows defining, calling, and assigning functions to variables. It has conditions like 'if' and 'else', and its mathematical expressions allow integers only.

					      <p>For Insper's Supercomputers module's second project, I worked with a problem in which concurrency plays a fundamental role in achieving good performance: downloading and analyzing web pages. For this study, a crawler that identifies product pages on an e-commerce site and extracts basic product information was created. Given a product display page, the web crawler extracts the following information: product name, product description, product photo url, spot price, installment price, product category, and display page url. The identification of product pages is made based on their category, which means that the developed crawler is pointed to a page with the products' category and manages to obtain the product pages, dealing with possible listing pagination.</p>
